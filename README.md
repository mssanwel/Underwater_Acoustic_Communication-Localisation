# Underwater_Acoustic_Communication-Localisation
Final year project for Underwater_Acoustic_Communication&amp;Localisation

The project includes a suggested design of a device that can be used to both communiate and localise UAVs underwater using sound. The setup uses easily accesible parts so that more researchers and hobbysits can develop this further. 
This code is opensource so that hobbysits and researchers dont have to start from scratch.

We hope that together we can make the oceans more accesible and push through innovative products. Have a look at our awesome work at BREED Robotics: [https://innoacademy.engg.hku.hk/robofishbreed2021/]
